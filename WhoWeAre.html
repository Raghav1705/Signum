            <h1> Who We Are </h1>
            <p>We are a team of four, extremely driven, and highly motivated UC Berkeley engineering students.
              What sets us apart is that this is our first-ever hackathon – and we hope to
              leverage this opportunity to build something sustainable, scalable, and deliver high impact. </p>
            <p>All four of us are passionate about addressing problems with universal design – the “one size
              fits all” model of designing that excludes large parts of the population, sometimes intentionally.
              We hope to build products with inclusive design, where “one size fits one”, to make sure we create
              solutions for those who are usually not considered, and then extend our application to many.
              One such example we chose to narrow down on and truly tackle was the idea of video conferencing –
              people with speech and hearing disabilities who aren’t able to converse on video call platforms
              because they aren’t built for understanding, processing, and translating sign language.  </p>
              <p>Signum is our way of solving for exactly that problem – something that might seem insignificant
                for those who don't have to struggle with it every single day. As undergraduate engineers that come
                from different areas of specialisation, we aspire to continue improving the lives of people around us.
                 Why Signum means so much to each one of us is that it ties all of our individual interests into one
                project – machine learning, software development, human-centred design, and most importantly,
                social impact – and channels it towards solving an extremely significant problem for people with speech
                and hearing disabilities.</p>
