            <h1> What We Do </h1>
            <p>On average, people speak about 16,000 words per day - our education, employment, and socialization
              necessitate constant verbal communication. For the approximately 1 million Americans
              who use American Sign Language (ASL) as their primary medium of communication in the United States, this is
              tragically not an option. When considering labor force statistics, unemployment and underemployment rates
              amongst deaf people are as high as 70% in the United States.
            </p>

            <p> Furthermore, 1 in 4 deaf people quit
              their jobs due to discrimination. Due to a lack of accommodations and opportunities outside of low-income jobs,
              many people with hearing and speech impairments are discouraged to pursue employment and opt out of the labor force.
              Thus, approximately 43% of deaf people are not in the labor force, compared to 22% of the general population.
              These people are restricted from equal opportunities to learn and rise in the workplace.
              Despite improvements in technology and accommodations that make it easier for deaf people to work, deaf job seekers say
              employers still do not believe they should be hired due to the difficulty in communication between employers and the deaf employees.
            </p>

            <p>To bolster their opportunities and bridge the gap of communication, we are developing Signum,
              a video chat platform for people with hearing and speech impairments,
              using a machine learning model to streamless translate American Sign Language (ASL) hand gestures to text and speech.
              In the short-term, our video call platform would give 18-35-year old employees with speaking impairments the opportunity
              to communicate more effectively with their colleagues, and give them the chance to build their skills and succeed in the workplace.
            </p>

            <p> Rather than having to type or handwrite, employees with speaking impairments can use our platform to seamlessly communicate with ASL,
              which is twice as fast as typing on average, enabling a natural, comfortable conversation where ASL speakers can effectively collaborate in the workplace.
              In the long-term, we will implement Signum in conjunction with popular video chat platforms such as Skype, Zoom, and Cisco WebEx.
