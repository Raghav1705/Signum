            <h1> How It Works </h1>
            <p>Signum is our web-interface solution for including people with hearing and speech disabilities on video-calling platforms.
              How Signum works is: we began with building and training our machine-learning
          model that recognises ASL (American Sign Language) gestures in real-time. The second part was to export this
          model to a web interface, where we could run the model and give feedback based on actual video input from the video camera. </p>

          <p> Signum then uses pattern recognition by breaking down the video frame-by-frame to predict with a
            high accuracy what letter or symbol the hand gesture depicts. Signum then translates this into
            text and speech on the other user’s screen, and thus the person at the other end of the video-call
            can now converse easily with someone who has such a disability. </p>

           <p> Our next goal is to make this a two-way video interface: where the person speaking has his words translated
           and depicted through ASL gestures on the differently-abled person’s screen, just to make conversations
           flow as seamlessly and naturally as possible. Through this design, we hope to be as
           inclusive as possible. In the future, we definitely see more use cases that we plan on creating: such as syncing our
           plug-in across YouTube videos, translating song lyrics on Spotify, and possibly extending it to
           Google’s Assistant and Apple’s Siri to recognise ASL gestures and then execute the command,
            search request, or any other function that the software is capable of doing – thereby solving
            for one purpose, but extending it to a multitude of platforms, and making life a little more comfortable for
            people who deserve it the most! </p>
